# CocoaSpecs 
This is Seamgen's custom public [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/making/private-cocoapods.html) spec repository. Use at your own risk!

## Add Seamgen Repo to your CocoaPods installation

To check if your installation is successful and ready to go:

`$ cd ~/.cocoapods/repos/seamgen`

`$ pod repo lint .`

Please consult the official CocoaPods documentation for more information on how to [create your own pod repo](https://guides.cocoapods.org/making/private-cocoapods.html) or [spec file](http://guides.cocoapods.org/making/specs-and-specs-repo.html).
